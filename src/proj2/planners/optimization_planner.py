            Uses your optimization based path planning algorithm to plan from the 
            start configuration to the goal configuration.

            This function interfaces with your matlab code from homework.
            We do this by saving all the information we need into a .mat
            file, and then operating on that .mat file with your matlab
            code. The result is saved in a .mat file, which we subsequently
            load into python, before processing it and returning the generated
            path as a Plan object.

            NOTE: You will need to make sure that your solutions for
            discrete_bicycle_dynamics.m use the right value for the length of the
            robot.

                    subsequent time-stamps.
